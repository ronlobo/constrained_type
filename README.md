<h3 align="center">Constrained Type</h3>

<p>A simple library (Rust learning project) to create on the fly value objects aka constrained types.</p>

<p>Constrained types guarantee a valid state and behavior of types by moving validation to the type creation process.</p>

<p>Helps removing defensive code statements and leveraging Rusts type system to implement business invariants.</p>

<p>Heavily inspired by everything "Domain Driven Design" and specifically by the book "Domain Modelling Made Functional" by Scott Wlaschin.</p>

<p>The original FSharp code inspiration <a href="https://github.com/swlaschin/DomainModelingMadeFunctional"> can be found at GitHub</a>.</p>
